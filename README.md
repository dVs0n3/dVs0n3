- 👋 Hi, I’m not really @dVs0n3
- 👀 I’m interested in ... stuff n things. but also other, *different* things that are whole unrelated to the first things i mentioned. entirely
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to edit my git profile. if u need help just ask. I'm like a pro now. It's ridiculous really how good i am
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything you're willing to do alone & give me credit for. if there is anyone actually interested in doing this (cuz ya never kno, ya kno}, like for serious, I'm all in. just let me kno when you start to see $$ coming in.
- 📫 How to reach me ... do ya really want to? I mean. No. Trust me here- just no. but if you should by some chance change your mind (& u totally should, I'm awesome and fun and cool), there's prolly some way to contact me thru git. don't really know mucha sh*t about git really.
